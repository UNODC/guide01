    <h3>18. Interviewing Victims</h3>

    <p>Before interviewing a migrant, you need to assess their welfare, which includes any requirements for food, water
        or medical treatment. You may also need to arrange an interpreter and, in some cases, a support person or
        trained counsellor. Inform the victim of his/her legal rights, and ensure that the victim and his/her family
        are not at risk.</p>

            <tr>
                <td><img class="alert" src="../imgs/G03_18.svg" /></td>
                <td style="vertical-align:middle">The migrant should be treated as a victim, not as a suspect.</td>

    <p>
        Have a female officer interview female victims or child victims whenever possible. Give the victim an
        opportunity to choose the gender of the interviewing officer. Remember that the victim should give his/her
        account of what has occurred. These questions are not exhaustive and are not in any particular order. These
        questions can be used to identify elements of the account that have not been covered by the migrant or that
        need elaboration.</p>

                    The migrant may dispose of legitimate travel documentation upon reaching their end destination. It
                    is important
                    to clarify where the migrant has legally travelled before reaching their destination.

    <h6 id="18-1-1">Sample Interview Questions for child victims:</h6>
    <p>Remember that the care and welfare of the child is the primary concern. Ensure the child has been fed, has slept
        and if necessary has been provided medical care prior to the interview.</p>

    <p>Child victims should not (as a rule) be interviewed where they live, be it their home or children’s shelter
        (Unless the shelter has a specific room set aside for interviewing).</p>

    <p>Rooms where children are interviewed should be ‘child friendly’ with a few toys, warm colours and soft carpets.</p>

    <p>The child should be asked basic questions in a language they can understand. Refrain from using baby talk.</p>

    <p>The child should be asked questions to determine if they know the difference between right and wrong.</p>

    <p>If possible do not to use leading questions.</p>

    <p>Children should not, where possible, be asked to repeat their account.</p>

    <p>The interview should be videotaped. This helps having to go over questions that may be distressing to the child.</p>

    <p>A support person should be provided for the child. The choice of this person will depend upon the circumstances
        of how the child was trafficked or smuggled.</p>

    <p>If the child’s account is very brief be careful about pushing the child too hard for further detail. You will
        run the risk of traumatizing the child.</p>

    <p>If the child’s account is very brief or where limited information is provided you may wish to consider stopping
        the interview. You may need to review the information you have at a later stage with a prosecutor and the
        child’s caregiver.</p>
