    <h2>18. Interviewing Victims</h2>

    <p>Before interviewing a migrant, you need to assess their welfare, which includes any requirements for food, water
        or medical treatment. You may also need to arrange an interpreter and, in some cases, a support person or
        trained counsellor. Inform the victim of his/her legal rights, and ensure that the victim and his/her family
        are not at risk.</p>

    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td style="width:100px"><img class="kInteractive image image628" src="../imgs/g03_18.svg" style="margin: 5px auto; clear: none; position: static; transition: none;" /></td>
                <td style="vertical-align:middle">The migrant should be treated as a victim, not as a suspect.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><br />
        Have a female officer interview female victims or child victims whenever possible. Give the victim an
        opportunity to choose the gender of the interviewing officer. Remember that the victim should give his/her
        account of what has occurred. These questions are not exhaustive and are not in any particular order. These
        questions can be used to identify elements of the account that have not been covered by the migrant or that
        need elaboration.</p>

    <p>The migrant may dispose of legitimate travel documentation upon reaching their end destination. It is important
        to clarify where the migrant has legally travelled before reaching their destination.</p>
