    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The movement of people from one country to another, fleeing persecution, war, disease, famine or in search of a
        better life, is a dangerous enterprise. The danger increases when criminal organizations smuggle irregular
        migrants for profit. Motivated by greed, criminals do not care for the welfare of victims and routinely risk
        the lives of migrants. Many thousands of human trafficking victims die each year.</p>

    <p>As a front line law enforcement officer, you may encounter people being smuggled or trafficked. These cases need
        to be handled with compassion and professionalism.</p>

    <p>You should carry this guide with you while you are on duty. It contains tools to address situations you may
        experience in the course of your duty.</p>
