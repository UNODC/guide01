    <h3>6. Operational Orders</h3>

    <p>You may find yourself operating in rural, urban or maritime environments. They each have different challenges
        and potential hazards. Consider the safety of investigators, suspects, and potential victims when planning
        operations. Raids and rescues are high-risk operations that should be a last resort. Only undertake them after
        systematic risk assessment and planning. While planning, considering the following points.<br />
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        What do you want your investigation to achieve?<br />
    </p>

    <h6>Method</h6>
    <p>
        How are you going to achieve it? Think of resources needed, separate transportation for suspected smugglers,
        traffickers, and victims, and preparing medical care.<br />
    </p>

    <h6>Administration</h6>
    <p>
        Consider all the logistical details necessary, such as timing, meals, support staff to deal with multiple
        suspected smugglers, traffickers, and victims, as well as media.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Conduct a risk assessment as per Section 7 on Assessing Risks in this field guide.<br />
    </p>

                    operation anywhere that members of the public can overhear.
