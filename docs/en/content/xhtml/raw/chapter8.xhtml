<h2>8. Surveillance</h2>

<p>Watching suspects can be a very useful way of gathering intelligence and evidence of a crime. You may use several types of surveillance.</p>

<h4>&#160;</h4>

<strong>Mobile</strong><br />
Good for covering distances and when the suspect is using a vehicle. Use several vehicles to follow the suspect. Use nondescript vehicles of different makes, models and colors. Rotate vehicles to avoid overexposure. Use two officers per car. Motorbikes are useful too.</p>

<strong>Marine</strong><br />
When following vessels, use navy or marine police vessels or aircraft that have the ability to track vessels from a long distance away. Use unmarked or nondescript boats to get closer to the targeted vessel. You could also watch vessels from the shore using a combination of mobile, foot or static surveillance methods.</p>

<strong>Foot</strong><br />
Good for following suspects who are walking or using public transport. Allows you to get closer to the suspect and observe their actions, meetings or hear conversations. Use at least three officers where possible. Rotate your positions to avoid being noticed.</p>

<p><br />

<strong>Static</strong><br />
Good for watching fixed locations like ports, houses, businesses or areas where a specific crime occurs. Use two officers. Be careful entering and leaving an observation post to avoid being compromised. If no buildings are available, use a vehicle or other hideout.</p>

<p><br />

<strong>Technical</strong><br />
Good for providing real-time locations of suspects. Use covert cameras, tracking and listening devices to observe suspects if you are lawfully entitled to use them.</p>

<p><br />

Safety first: Do not put yourself at risk. Use sufficient officers and vehicles to avoid being compromised. Make sure your equipment is charged and ready.</p>

<p>Remember: It is better to lose the suspect than to compromise the investigation â€ƒ</p>
