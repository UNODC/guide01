    <h6>Sample Interview Questions for child victims:</h6>
    <br />
    <p>Remember that the care and welfare of the child is the primary concern. Ensure the child has been fed, has slept
        and if necessary has been provided medical care prior to the interview.</p>

    <p>Child victims should not (as a rule) be interviewed where they live, be it their home or children’s shelter
        (Unless the shelter has a specific room set aside for interviewing).</p>

    <p>Rooms where children are interviewed should be ‘child friendly’ with a few toys, warm colours and soft carpets.</p>

    <p>The child should be asked basic questions in a language they can understand. Refrain from using baby talk.</p>

    <p>The child should be asked questions to determine if they know the difference between right and wrong.</p>

    <p>If possible do not to use leading questions.</p>

    <p>Children should not, where possible, be asked to repeat their account.</p>

    <p>The interview should be videotaped. This helps having to go over questions that may be distressing to the child.</p>

    <p>A support person should be provided for the child. The choice of this person will depend upon the circumstances
        of how the child was trafficked or smuggled.</p>

    <p>If the child’s account is very brief be careful about pushing the child too hard for further detail. You will
        run the risk of traumatizing the child.</p>

    <p>If the child’s account is very brief or where limited information is provided you may wish to consider stopping
        the interview. You may need to review the information you have at a later stage with a prosecutor and the
        child’s caregiver.</p>
