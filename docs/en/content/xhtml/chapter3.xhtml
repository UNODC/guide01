<h2>3. Intelligence Reports</h2>

<p>Once you have received information from a source, you must complete an intelligence report as soon as possible. Remember, the source could be from the community, a government agency, or a general informant. The report should comply with your agency’s guidelines and contain the following information:</p><br/>

<ul>
	<li>Date of the report</li>
	<li>Subject</li>
	<li>Officer making the report</li>
	<li>Account of the information provided (who, what, when, where, why, how)</li>
	<li>Your assessment of:<br />
	(a) the reliability of the source and<br />
	(b) the accuracy of the information</li>
</ul>

<p>The report should not contain any information that may reveal the identity of the informant. Do not include the informant’s name, alias, sex, date of birth, occupation, contact details, or clues leading to their identity. Submit the completed report through authorized channels without delay so that the information can be assessed and, if necessary, disseminated.</p>
